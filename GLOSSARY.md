# yesid.design
Shared UI, tokens and motion packages that every yesid product builds from.

## Language

**Language signpost**:
The brand language link with one board per supported locale. The system draws and cycles English,
French and Spanish in that order, then other locales in their supplied order. Products choose
which languages they support, their default and their copy.
_Avoid_: product language order

**Section**:
A collapsible content card on a detail page, with a heading and a body. Only the heading button toggles it.
An optional summary keeps the finding, period and caveat visible when the body is open or closed.
_Avoid_: card (on detail pages), panel, disclosure

**Expand-all control**:
The single page action that opens every content section, or collapses them all when any is open. Pages with at least two content sections start expanded; after Collapse all the control turns orange, and the visitor's bulk choice is remembered across the site and visits. Individual toggles affect only that view. The TOC and independent panels keep their own state.
_Avoid_: quiet mode, per-section preference, Remember/Forget actions

**Filter group**:
A collapsible group of filters in a listing rail. Not touched by the expand-all control.
_Avoid_: section

**Section jump**:
Navigation to a content section at the shared reading line, opening that section and its
enclosing sections while preserving every other section's state.
_Avoid_: TOC scroll helper

**Navigation lifecycle**:
The shared coordination of page navigation, menu closure, language-switch intent, focus and
interrupted scrolling.
_Avoid_: header router

**Station tabs**:
The shared signage look for tab controls and navigation links. Selection, navigation, strip
geometry, scrolling and swipe handling belong to the caller.
_Avoid_: shared tab router

**Pointer effect**:
A visual response available to a hover-capable fine pointer, including a secondary mouse on a
touch device. Its motion tier also determines whether reduced motion permits it.
_Avoid_: desktop-only effect

**Touch-only feedback**:
Press feedback for a touch-capable device without a hover-capable fine pointer. Devices with
such a pointer use the same press baseline as desktops.
_Avoid_: mobile animation

**Release rehearsal**:
Verification of one exact prerelease in a product's own adoption change, through its own checks and affected real callers, before stable promotion. The same change becomes the consumer adoption once it points at the stable release. Required when API reports or migration notes change.
_Avoid_: Gallery acceptance, throwaway rehearsal branch

**Consumer adoption**:
A product's reviewed integration of one exact stable release; it may begin as that release's rehearsal. Publication, adoption and deployed acceptance each need their own evidence.
_Avoid_: automatic sync, merging a prerelease

**Register**: The amount of expression a page or region spends: expressive, reading or task.
Light and dark are a separate axis. An undeclared page is reading.

**Signature**: An expressive element approved by the owner by name, with its job and conditions.

**Evidence**: Anything a reader takes as measured fact, including a number, status, date or lamp.
It needs a source, subject and time.

**Demonstration**: Simulated content shown on purpose, labelled beside the figures it explains.
